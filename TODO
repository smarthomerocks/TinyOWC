- Fix tinyowc_distribute_heat set to true on first setup
- Implement heat distribution logic with the help of groups and a separate MQTT-topic(?)
- Implement logic for always having one shunt open within a single group, to prevent pump from working against all closed shunts
- Add retry logic for reading counters in DS2423
- Support more than _one_ DS2408 on a 1-Wire buss, current SKIP_ROM prevent this.
- Security support (credentials for MQTT and login for HTML status page)
- Use Server Side Events instead of hacky full-page reload every 10 seconds
